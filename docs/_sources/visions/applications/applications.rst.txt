Applications
============

This section discusses viewing the concepts of `visions` with respect to subsequent application.
We find this view intuitive to create understanding of:

- for what we want to create types, typesets and relations
- the benefits of using visions in practice

It is limited for:

- abstract concepts

The potential applications for `visions` are broad.
The motivating use case came from analytics (specifically pandas-profiling) so we will start with descriptive statistics.
Then, we will shortly touch predictive analytics/machine learning and reducing memory footprint.
